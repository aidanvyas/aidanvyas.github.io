        <p>
            I'm Aidan Vyas, a senior at Rice University studying Economics and
            Computer Science. I'll be moving to NYC this summer to start working
            at a systematic global macro hedge fund (if you're in town, please
            reach out and say hi). I plan to spend my career working on
            empirical asset pricing and artificial intelligence, but I am also
            interested in politics, longevity, sports, and food.
        </p>

        <p>
            I would like to provide a defense of why one should spend their
            lives focused on AI and asset pricing. The case for AI is rather
            self-explanatory and non-controversial. Artificial intelligence is
            simply that––artificial intelligence. The hope is that as we
            approach artificial general intelligence (AGI), anything that humans
            can do now machines will be able to do. The main advantages of
            machines is that they are cheaper, faster, and potentially smarter
            than human beings.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most people intuitively understand that ChatGPT can draft a cheaper
            and faster (and perhaps better) essay than the average writer. And
            as artificial intelligence continues to improve, the scope of
            problems that it can tackle widens. I believe that AI has the
            capability to help us solve all of physics, cure every disease,
            explore the galaxy, and deliver world peace––all in my lifetime––and
            I hope to contribute to this progress.
        </p>

        <p>
            The case for working on empirical asset pricing is less obvious, but
            arguably just as important. Firstly, what is empirical asset
            pricing? Asset pricing is simply the study of why assets are priced
            the way that they are. In essence, why is the S&P 500 at 5,000
            instead of 500 or 50,000? And baked into the question of prices is
            why returns are what they are. Why does the S&P 500 return 12%
            instead of 1.2% or 120%? And empirical just means that we care more
            about results than theories.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the last century, short-term interest rates have averaged
            around 3%, so if at the beginning of each year you took out a loan
            and bought the S&P 500, you would make 9% a year on average. If you
            borrowed $100, you would make $9. And if you borrowed $1 billion,
            you would have made $90 million. Now why doesn't everyone do this?
            How is this not an infinite money glitch?
        </p>

        <p>
            Well for one the S&P 500 is a risky investment. Its returns are not
            always 12%. The standard deviation (or volatility) of annual returns
            is 20%, meaning that annual returns can reasonably be expected to
            range from -29% to 51%. In the case where returns are negative and
            you borrowed money, you would owe your lender a large shortfall.
        </p>

        <p>
            And secondly, the worst case scenarios for the S&P typically
            coincide with downturns in the real economy. So not only do you run
            the risk of losing money some years, you lose money precisely when
            you need it the most (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis).
        </p>

        <p>
            Diving deeper, most of the field focused on cross-sectional asset
            pricing, or how certain assets are priced relative to each other and
            what this says about their future returns. For instance, it is
            widely known that Warren Buffett has had an exemplary investing
            track record and part of the reason for his outperformance is value
            investing––buying stocks that are cheap relative to their
            fundamentals.
        </p>

        <p>
            Why does value investing work so well? Perhaps it's because value
            stocks are more risky, i.e., the returns of these companies vary
            more widely than the overall market or that they are in greater
            danger during bad economic times. Or perhaps it's because they are
            simply mispriced because investors would rather boast about owning
            tech companies compared to textile or tobacco companies at cocktail
            parties. Or perhaps it's some combination of the two.
        </p>

        <p>
            Two groups of the financial services industry that deserve
            particular defense are long-short equity managers and market makers
            (high-frequency traders) who make money via identifying mispricings
            and bearing risks, respectively. Most people understand if you
            wanted to sell your house within a month, you would probably get
            something close to fair market value. However, if you wanted to sell
            your house within a minute, you would get pennies on the dollars.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is obviously a suboptimal situation driven by the illiquidity
            of the housing market. A world where you could get 99.9% of your
            home's fair value in a minute would obviously be beneficial to you,
            and the 0.1% spread is what market makers collect in exchange for
            accepting the risk of adverse selection––e.g., you might be selling
            your house because you have inside information on the quality of the
            roofing or foundation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The case for long-short equity managers is a bit more opaque. The
            act of shorting a stock is often thought of as unethical, but in
            reality, it helps make markets less volatile (leading to less
            frequent bubbles and downturns) and can help to expose frauds.
            However, the biggest benefit of these investors is that they help to
            set prices efficiently in the market.
        </p>

        <p>
            Why does this matter? Why does it matter if a stock is mispriced or
            a market is inefficient? Well prices are the mechanism in which
            business owners can access capital. If prices are too high relative
            to the fundamentals, then capital is wasted on fads, and if prices
            are too low, then valuable projects go underfunded. An extreme
            antithesis of an efficient market is a communist society where the
            government sets all prices, leading to fewer innovations and a lower
            standard of living for all.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most convincing argument against working in finance is that
            almost everyone who works in finance is extremely smart and society
            would be better served if we expanded our talents on more useful
            endeavours––like developing new medicines or creating new
            inventions. And my counterargument to this is that efficient capital
            markets allow very best scientists to raise the money on the best
            possible terms, supporting innovation economy-wide.
        </p>

        <p>
            While I don't view empirical asset pricing and artificial
            intelligence to be naturally connected, I do believe that if we were
            able to successfully apply AI to finance, we could help the market
            generate more efficient prices, leading to a more just and efficient
            allocation of resources, which would benefit all of society.
